# ChatColours

This plugin allows players to change their name and chat colour in-game using a GUI.  
This plugin works with **placeholderAPI** and the **chatmanager** plugin.  


### Inside the chatmanager plugin input:  
`%ChatColor_custom_displayname%` - Will give the coloured display name  
`%ChatColor_custom_message%` - Will give the chat message  

- All information on the GUI is stored and editable inside the config.
- Each slot inside the GUI can be edited to whatever item you want, the name of the item and whatever colour you want your text/name colour to be.
- If a colour isnâ€™t available to a player it will show up with a barrier block to indicate this.
- This is a very customizable plugin where you can change each item, value, colour and permissions.
- There is an option of adding rainbow colours where after each letter the colour will change.
